First time coding
My Name is David Payton and I am completely new to coding. Im 40 years old, im a Fiber Optic OSP Master Splicer, and Ive been building web pages for years as a hobby. I need a specific type of program, and havent been able to find what i want, so i am going to attempt to build it myself.
